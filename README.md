# Decentralized ToDo List
# Project Description
The Decentralized ToDo List is a blockchain-based application designed to store and manage personal tasks. By leveraging the blockchain, tasks are transparent, immutable, and verifiable, ensuring that users can keep track of their to-do lists in a decentralized manner. This Move smart contract allows users to create tasks and mark them as completed while storing the data on the Aptos blockchain.
# Vision
The vision of the Decentralized ToDo List is to provide users with a transparent, decentralized platform to manage their personal tasks. It aims to enhance user privacy, ensure data integrity, and enable users to manage their tasks without relying on centralized services.
# Key Features
Create Tasks: Users can create tasks with a description, which are stored on the blockchain.
Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, updating their status on the blockchain.
Immutability: Once a task is created, its description cannot be altered, ensuring transparency.
Blockchain Transparency: All tasks are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
# Smart Contract Overview
create_task(account: &signer, description: vector<u8>): Allows users to create a task with a specific description.
mark_task_completed(account: &signer): Marks a task as completed.
# Future Scope
Task Deletion: Adding functionality to delete tasks from the list.
Task Filtering: Enable users to filter tasks based on their status (completed or not).
Multiple Tasks Management: Allow users to create, manage, and complete multiple tasks at once.
Task Due Date: Add the ability to set due dates for tasks.
Collaboration Features: Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same to-do list.
